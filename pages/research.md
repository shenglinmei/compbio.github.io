# Research

The Mei Laboratory studies the remodeling and regulatory mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression and metastasis. The lab specializes in computational biology, and combines single-cell technologies, genomic datasets, machine learning, and experimental methods to investigate how the tumor microenvironment and gene regulatory factors control tumor metastasis cascade. By advancing our understanding of malignant cell heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment remodeling, we aim to drive the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with metastatic cancer. The current focuses in lab include the following directions:   

- Developing computational methods for integrating multi-modal data, including scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, ChIP-seq, and CRISPR screening, et al.

- Context depedent tumor mocroenviroment remodeling. 
     
- Uncovering novel regulators of the tumor microenvironment.
     
- Understanding tumor organ specific metastasis with multi-omics data integration.
