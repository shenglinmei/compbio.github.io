## We are actively hiring!
The Mei Laboratory studies the remodeling and regulatory mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression and  metastasis. The lab combines single-cell technologies, genomic datasets, machine learning, and experimental methods to investigate how the tumor microenvironment and gene regulatory factors control tumor metastasis cascade.  By advancing our understanding of malignant cell heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment remodeling, we aim to drive the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with metastatic cancer. The current focuses in lab include the following directions: 1) Developing computational methods for integrating multi-modal data, including scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, ChIP-seq, and CRISPR screening, et al. 2) Context depedent tumor mocroenviroment remodeling. 3) Uncovering novel regulators of the tumor microenvironment. 4) Understanding tumor organ specific metastasis with multi-omics data integration.


### Computational Biology Postdoc Position

We are seeking highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to join our team. The successful candidates will collaborate with researchers across multiple institutions. Our lab is primarily affiliated with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute (FBRI) Cancer Research Center DC of Virginia Tech and jointly we are members of the Children's National Center for Cancer and Immunology Research.
